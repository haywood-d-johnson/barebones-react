## Description

 ```create-react-app``` is just a little too large to teach and learn and teach React basics. This is my preferred boilerplate that can handle the major needs for React and get things rendered quicker.

## Getting Started

To run this project, download or clone from the terminal and run using yarn/npm:

```
cd barebones-react
npm install/yarn install
npm start/yarn start
```

```webpack``` will build and watch the bundle.js file, but it is in the ```.gitignore``` 



use ```git remote show origin``` then ```git remote rm origin``` to clean and then rename the file in ```index.js```, ```package.json```, and rename the root folder. 

## Technologies

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

  

## Plans

-   [ ] Add React Router
-   [ ] Add Testing
-   [ ] Add TypeScript Support
